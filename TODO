it does not detect when the machine goes into an error state

differences:

  - need to be able to query flavors (needs to be fixed in fog)

currently, flavors can only be queried through the admin api when admin_api is set to true

  - if credentials are borked, the error message we get back needs to be more helpful
  - I need to understand what region is for in openstack
  - it only checks if machines boot correctly, but does not notice if a created instance
    enters an error state
